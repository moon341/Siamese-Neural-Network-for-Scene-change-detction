# Siamese-Neural-Network-for-Scene-change-detction
In this file, the idea of siamese neural network is implemented using the encoder of  pretarined VGG19 on Imagenet dataset. The different pooling layers from encoder are used and the feature maps generated in these pooling layers while giving them our desired input image. These features are then concatenate by using the concatenation function of tensorflow which can only concatenate the tensors. The final tensor (after concatenation ) is then saved and this wholes process is done once more for another image. Now we have two tensors from two different images and we subtract them to create a change map.
